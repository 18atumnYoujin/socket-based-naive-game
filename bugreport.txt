upd:
the following bug has been solved by ycpedef.
-----

In some situation, server will be unable to start:
[ERROR] server_start:913: Can not bind to port xxx!
		/\
		||
This happens when a user uses ^c to exit the client during a battle with another player, triggering a server message "broken pipe". The server shuts down and the other user's client is still running.

Fixed: UI bug after pressing the "launch battle" button with a friend invited.
Fixed: UI bug after pressing the "launch battle" button without invition.
Fixed: UI bug after quiting a battle and launching a new battle.
Fixed: The friendlist catalog is not drawn on login(even when there are friends online).
Fixed: Input error when the input includes characters like backspace,up,down,etc.
Fixed: Type any illegal key in main_ui or start_ui, mysterious box will be shown.
Fixed: After sending 'launch battle' with a friend's name, the friend will be immediately put into battle whether he answered it or not.
Fixed: The enemy will be shown in position(1,1), but nobody is there.
Fixed: Battlefield output error: when player is at the left border, he will need two 'right' operation to move right. The same situation occurs at the top border.

Modified: Bullets and characters can walk through walls.
